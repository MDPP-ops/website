# Work packages

M-DPP is organised into four interconnected work packages that run across the project's two-year timeline (2025–2027).

---

## WP 1 — Requirements and stakeholder alignment

Map the regulatory, technical, and organisational requirements for molecular-level DPPs in the textile sector. This work package brings together SMEs, recyclers, policymakers, and standards bodies to establish shared definitions, use cases, and success criteria that guide the rest of the project.

---

## WP 2 — Data model and identifiers

Develop a data model that links material identity at the molecular level to components and finished products. This includes defining how molecular fingerprints, composition data, and provenance information are structured, stored, and referenced within a DPP-compatible framework.

---

## WP 3 — Technical architecture

Design and prototype the infrastructure for capturing molecular data, storing it in an open reference database, and exchanging it across the value chain. The architecture is built on open standards and accessible APIs, with the aim of interoperating with emerging European data spaces and reporting systems (e.g., EPR).

---

## WP 4 — Pilots and evaluation

Test the developed methods and infrastructure in real-world settings with Dutch textile partners. Industry Living Labs with byBorre, Knitwear Lab, and New Order of Fashion (NOoF) evaluate what works, what breaks, and what scales. A citizen-science component investigates how end-users interact with DPP information, including aspects of digital literacy, trust, and behaviour.
