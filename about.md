## Why Digital Product Passports are required

From **July 2027**, many products placed on the EU market must have a
**Digital Product Passport (DPP)** to comply with the
**Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)**.

A DPP is not a marketing label.
It is a structured, digital record that makes product information accessible
to authorities, supply-chain partners, and, in some cases, end users.

For companies, this means being able to show—digitally and verifiably:

- what materials a product contains
- where those materials come from
- how claims about composition or sustainability are supported
- who is responsible for the information

## What this means for small companies (MKB)

The ESPR does not only apply to large brands.

If you are a small company that:
- sells physical products in the EU
- places products on the market under your own name
- supplies larger companies that must be compliant

then DPP requirements will affect you directly.

In practice, small companies are often asked for information by:
- customers further down the value chain
- platform operators
- auditors or market surveillance authorities

Without a structured way to manage this information, market access can become difficult or impossible.

## Why "having the right materials" is not sufficient

Many small companies already try to make responsible choices:
- selecting better materials
- working with trusted suppliers
- avoiding exaggerated sustainability claims

Under ESPR, these choices must be **supported by evidence**.

It must be clear:
- which material is used in which product
- based on which declaration, test, or certificate
- from which supplier
- under which assumptions and limitations

If this information is incomplete, unclear, or inconsistent,
a product may be considered **non-compliant**, even if the material itself is appropriate.

## What M-DPP is

**M-DPP** is a two-year applied research project (2025–2027) developed by
**Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences**
and
**HAN University of Applied Sciences**,
co-funded by NWO/SIA.

The project applies a **design-science methodology**:
knowledge is generated by building, testing, and evaluating working solutions
in realistic contexts with real companies.

M-DPP focuses on the practical question:
*What does a Digital Product Passport need to look like in order to actually work for small companies?*

## What the project investigates for small companies

M-DPP is designed with companies in mind that lack:
- dedicated compliance teams
- legal departments
- complex data infrastructures

The project addresses the following areas:

### Understanding what data is required
Not all possible data is required.
M-DPP clarifies which information is essential under ESPR and which is not.

### Assessing whether material information is usable
Supplier declarations and certificates are assessed for:
- completeness
- clarity
- suitability for DPP use

This helps companies understand where gaps or risks exist.

### Structuring information in a DPP-ready way
Material and product information is linked explicitly to:
- products
- materials
- suppliers
- claims

This structure allows information to be reused in future DPP systems,
instead of being recreated each time.

### Reducing compliance risk
By making uncertainty, scope, and responsibility explicit,
M-DPP helps companies avoid overclaiming and unintended non-compliance.

## Why this matters now

Although July 2027 may seem distant, requirements are already shaping today's market:

- larger companies are already requesting DPP-style data
- pilot systems are being rolled out
- expectations about structure and terminology are being fixed now

Small companies that prepare early are better positioned to:
- maintain market access
- respond to customer requests
- avoid last-minute, costly adaptations

M-DPP exists to support that preparation through applied research and open, evidence-based tools.
