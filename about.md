## Why Digital Product Passports are required

From **July 2027**, many products placed on the EU market must have a
**Digital Product Passport (DPP)** to comply with the
**Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)**.

A DPP is not a marketing label.
It is a structured, digital record that makes product information accessible
to authorities, supply-chain partners, and, in some cases, end users.

For companies, this means being able to show—digitally and verifiably:

- what materials a product contains  
- where those materials come from  
- how claims about composition or sustainability are supported  
- who is responsible for the information

## What this means for small companies (MKB)

The ESPR does not only apply to large brands.

If you are a small company that:
- sells physical products in the EU  
- places products on the market under your own name  
- supplies larger companies that must be compliant  

then DPP requirements will affect you directly.

In practice, small companies are often asked for information by:
- customers further down the value chain  
- platform operators  
- auditors or market surveillance authorities  

Without a structured way to manage this information, market access can become difficult or impossible.

## Why “having the right materials” is not sufficient

Many small companies already try to make responsible choices:
- selecting better materials  
- working with trusted suppliers  
- avoiding exaggerated sustainability claims  

Under ESPR, these choices must be **supported by evidence**.

It must be clear:
- which material is used in which product  
- based on which declaration, test, or certificate  
- from which supplier  
- under which assumptions and limitations  

If this information is incomplete, unclear, or inconsistent,
a product may be considered **non-compliant**, even if the material itself is appropriate.

## What M-DPP is

**M-DPP** is a research and implementation project developed by
**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**
and
**:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}**.

The project applies a **design-science methodology**:
knowledge is generated by building, testing, and evaluating working solutions
in realistic contexts with real companies.

M-DPP focuses on the practical question:
*What does a Digital Product Passport need to look like in order to actually work for small companies?*

## How M-DPP supports small companies

M-DPP is designed for companies without:
- dedicated compliance teams  
- legal departments  
- complex data infrastructures  

The project helps small companies to:

### Understand what data is required
Not all possible data is required.
M-DPP clarifies which information is essential under ESPR and which is not.

### Check whether material information is usable
Supplier declarations and certificates are assessed for:
- completeness  
- clarity  
- suitability for DPP use  

This helps companies understand where gaps or risks exist.

### Structure information in a DPP-ready way
Material and product information is linked explicitly to:
- products  
- materials  
- suppliers  
- claims  

This structure allows information to be reused in future DPP systems,
instead of being recreated each time.

### Reduce compliance risk
By making uncertainty, scope, and responsibility explicit,
M-DPP helps companies avoid overclaiming and unintended non-compliance.

## Why this matters now

Although July 2027 may seem distant, requirements are already shaping today’s market:

- larger companies are already requesting DPP-style data  
- pilot systems are being rolled out  
- expectations about structure and terminology are being fixed now  

Small companies that prepare early are better positioned to:
- maintain market access  
- respond to customer requests  
- avoid last-minute, costly adaptations  

M-DPP exists to support that preparation in a realistic and proportionate way.
