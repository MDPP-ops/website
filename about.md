          Why Digital Product Passports are required
        </h1>
        <p class="lead mb-0">
          From <strong>July 2027</strong>, many products placed on the EU market must have a
          <strong>Digital Product Passport (DPP)</strong> to comply with the
          <strong>Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)</strong>.
          A DPP is not a marketing label&mdash;it is a structured, digital record that makes
          product information accessible to authorities, supply-chain partners, and end users.

        <p class="text-secondary mb-0">
          The ESPR does not only apply to large brands. If you sell physical products in the EU,
          place products on the market under your own name, or supply larger companies that must
          be compliant, then DPP requirements will affect you directly.

            Under ESPR, responsible material choices must be supported by verifiable evidence&mdash;declarations,
            tests, or certificates linked to specific products and suppliers.

        <p class="text-secondary mb-0">
          <strong>M-DPP</strong> is a two-year applied research project (2025&ndash;2027) developed by
          <strong>Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences</strong> and
          <strong>HAN University of Applied Sciences</strong>, co-funded by NWO/SIA.
          The project applies a <strong>design-science methodology</strong>: knowledge is generated
          by building, testing, and evaluating working solutions in realistic contexts with real companies.

<!-- WHY NOW -->

    <div class="row align-items-center g-3">

        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-2">Why this matters now</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary mb-0">
          Although July 2027 may seem distant, larger companies are already requesting DPP-style data,
          pilot systems are being rolled out, and expectations about structure and terminology are being
          fixed now. Small companies that prepare early are better positioned to maintain market access,
          respond to customer requests, and avoid last-minute, costly adaptations.
