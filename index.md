# M-DPP — Digital Product Passports 

This site documents the M-DPP project and its work on implementing Digital Product Passports (DPPs) in real value-chain contexts, with an emphasis on molecular/material-level traceability and practical deployment.

## What we build
- A pragmatic DPP implementation pattern (data model + governance + workflows)
- A demonstrator pathway from material identification to product-level DPP records
- Documentation: requirements, architecture, pilot learnings, and outputs

## Why it matters
DPPs only become meaningful when data can be generated, verified, and reused across actors. The project focuses on the “boring-hard” parts: data quality, identifiers, interfaces, and operational accountability.
